### Usage
This is a trigger-based ADC implementation, you need an input pulse signal to act as a cycling trigger, (I am using steady square wave function generator). Connect the pulse source to one of the GPIO and edit in sorce code accordingly.

Connect the targeted signal to one of the Analog Channel and adjust the source code accordingly.
